what is difference in HI 1,2,3?
we are dealing with CDR's that are already available at our client server(PTCL) right??
read about CDR's there are enough details about call records. my question is can we say all records related to telecommunication are CDR's with different name in parameters?
we have already enough information related to cdr's!!
we explained our understandings in last two sessions with you is that was enough to understand for what we are going to develop?
we have to deal with Teradata for HI2 module ??
